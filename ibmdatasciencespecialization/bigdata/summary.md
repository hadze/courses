Things learned:

* How Big Data is defined by the Vs: Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Value.
* How Hadoop and other tools, combined with distributed computing power,  are used to handle the demands of Big Data.  
* What skills are required to analyse Big Data. 
* About the process of Data Mining, and how it produces results.

Questions:

* According to the reading, the output of a data mining exercise largely depends on the skills of the data scientist carrying out the exercise.
--> False

* When data are missing in a systematic way, you can simply extrapolate the data or impute the missing data by filling in the average of the values around the missing data.
--> False
Correct. When data are missing in a systematic way, you should determine the impact of missing data on the results and whether missing data can be excluded from the analysis.

* What is an example of a data reduction algorithm?
Prior Variable Analysis.
Cojoint Analysis.
A/B Testing.
Correct --> Principal Component Analysis.

* After the data are appropriately processed, transformed, and stored, machine learning and non-parametric methods are a good starting point for data mining.
--> False

* In-sample forecast is the process of formally evaluating the predictive capabilities of the models developed using observed data to see how effective the algorithms are in reproducing data.
--> True
